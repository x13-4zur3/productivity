## ⚠️ **Do Not Open Issues for Security Vulnerabilities**
Please **do not open an issue** in the repository for security-related problems. This is to prevent public exposure of the vulnerability.

   - **Severity**: An estimate of the severity (e.g., high, medium, low).
   - **Impact**: A brief explanation of the potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - **Proof of Concept**: (Optional) If you have a proof of concept, please include it.

2. **Security Review**: Our security team will review the issue and assess the necessary actions. We will acknowledge receipt of your report and provide feedback on how we will address it.

3. **Fixes & Patches**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to release a fix as quickly as possible. You will be notified once the issue is resolved and patched.
